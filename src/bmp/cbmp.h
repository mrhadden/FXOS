 BMP format
 The data in this format is divided into three to four parts, in order:
 File information header (14 bytes) stores file type, file size and other information
 The picture information header (40 bytes) stores the picture size, color index, bit plane number and other information
 Palette (determined by the number of color indexes) [may not have this information]
 Bitmap data (determined by the image size) information for each pixel is stored here

 The general bmp image is 24 bits, which is true color. Every 8 bits is a byte, and 24 bits use three bytes to store the information of each pixel. The three bytes correspond to the data of the three primary colors of r, g, and b.
 The storage range of each byte is 0-255. Then by analogy, a 32-bit image stores four data of r, g, b, a (Alpha channel, storage transparency) per pixel. 8-bit image is only the grayscale information,
 There is also a binary image, which has only two colors, black or white.
